Ars Run is a game where you, the "Ars", runs away while avoiding police and collecting Hamsa signs.
There are three modes: Slow, Fast, Sensor (controled by tilting the screen to the sides for avoiding obstacles and tilting back and forth for increasing and decreasing the speed).
Leader Board screen shows your highscore and your location.

The design is a comic view of a "thug" (ערס) that runs away from police to the sound of the isreali nizrakhit song by jacky mekaiten "המענטזת".
